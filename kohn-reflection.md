# Alfie Kohn's Grade Reflection

I think there is a lot of time where my grade was lower than what I have learned. In most of my examinations, I have scored lower grades than I had expected. To say about one incident where I scored lower would be in business management during my undergrad. I scored too low because of my low internal mask which I received before my final exam from my professor. However, my final written exam went exceptionally well, and I got a good score, but my total score turned out to be low compared to my knowledge in that field.

Grades are the way to evaluate the knowledge of the student, but I think it doesn’t clearly define the ability of the students because there are many external factors that impact the scoring of the grades. Grades are numbers and alphabets to represent the knowledge of the students but there are a lot of factors to take into consideration to know the knowledge of someone. Grading has been a part of my life for a very long time. My family and friends always evaluate my knowledge with my grade, so I always feel pressured to achieve good grades. Due to this pressure and importance being given to grades I have a pretty bad experience with grades.

For people to be motivated, a grade is not the only factor to motivate the student to work hard. In my point of view, grading limits students’ creativity because it has lots of regulations to be followed. Alternative to the grading system I would use the following for motivating me:
investing my creativity in the topics I like 
* Getting feedback from my teacher.
* Developing portfolios with my knowledge.
* Grades are not only the ways to express our knowledge we can do it in many ways which I have stated above and still learning will have the same values without grading.

There has been a lot of time where I have taken an easy way out to get better grades. One incident would be during my last semester in undergrad because I chose a research topic that was easy and simple which would guarantee a good score compared to the topic in which my interest was. I have taken the easy way out by choosing a research topic that I have good knowledge of rather than choosing a new topic of my interest. The reason for choosing this route was mostly because of the pressure of getting good grades and not risking my final undergraduate marks.
